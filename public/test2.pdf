The Request for Proposal (RFP) titled "Application Software Development Services" (RFP 
No. ITV/19072019/OUT/01871 dated July 22, 2019) is issued by the Small Industries 
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to engage a qualified service provider for the 
development, maintenance, and support of its application software. The project is set 
to span three years, from November 1, 2019, to October 31, 2022. The scope of work 
includes the development of new applications, enhancement of existing ones, and 
ongoing support services. This work will be conducted using a combination of onsite, 
offshore, or hybrid models, depending on the specific requirements of SIDBI. The 
selected service provider will also be responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of 
all software applications, handling version control, implementing changes, optimizing 
performance, and providing day-to-day user support. 
The RFP outlines a detailed evaluation methodology that includes a three-stage 
process: eligibility criteria, technical evaluation, and commercial evaluation. Initially, 
bids will be assessed based on the minimum eligibility criteria, followed by a technical 
evaluation of the proposed solution and resources. The final selection will be made 
based on the lowest commercial bid (L1) submitted by technically qualified bidders. The 
selected vendor will need to deploy a team of skilled professionals who meet the 
qualifications specified in the RFP, manage the projects effectively, and adhere to the 
timelines and quality standards set by SIDBI. 
The RFP also includes provisions for liquidated damages to ensure accountability and 
timely delivery of services. Penalties will be imposed for delays in resource deployment, 
software development, and maintenance activities, with specific percentages outlined 
for various levels of non-compliance. The total value of the project will be determined 
based on the commercial bids received, with an emphasis on cost-effectiveness and 
quality of service. 
The due date for submitting bids is August 13, 2019, by 4:00 PM, and potential bidders 
are encouraged to seek any necessary clarifications by July 26, 2019. The successful 
bidder will be required to commence services promptly upon award and ensure a 
seamless transition and ongoing support throughout the contract period. This RFP 
represents a significant opportunity for service providers to partner with SIDBI in 
enhancing its technological capabilities and supporting its mission to promote and 
develop small industries in India.
